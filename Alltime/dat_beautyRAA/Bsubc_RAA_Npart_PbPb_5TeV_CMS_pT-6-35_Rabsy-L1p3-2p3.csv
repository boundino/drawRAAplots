#: name: Bc RAA vs centrality
#: description: The $B_c$ meson nuclear modification factor in PbPb collisions, in centrality bins, integrated over the studied kinematic range. The cut on the trimuon rapidity depends on the trimuon $p_T$. The total uncertainty is decomposed in a bin-to-bin-uncorrelated uncertainty and one fully correlated along the two bins. The centrality bin markers are placed at the minimum bias average number of participants $N_{part}$.
