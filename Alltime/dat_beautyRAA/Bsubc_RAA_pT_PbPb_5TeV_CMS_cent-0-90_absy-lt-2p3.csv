#: name: Bc RAA vs pT
#: description: The $B_c$ meson nuclear modification factor in PbPb collisions, in $p_T^{\mu\mu\mu}$ bins corresponding to different trimuon rapidity ranges. The total uncertainty is decomposed in a bin-to-bin-uncorrelated uncertainty and one fully correlated along the two bins. The markers of the $p_T^{\mu\mu\mu}$ bins are placed at the average of the Lafferty-Wyatt prescriptions applied to the pp and PbPb spectra.
