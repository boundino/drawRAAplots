#: description: The nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ versus $\langle N_\text{part} \rangle$ for inclusive $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ production in the centrality range $0-100\%$, $0-30\%$ and $30-100\%$. The systematic uncertainties include the PbPb systematic uncertainties associated with the signal extraction, $p_{T}$ spectrum, selection criteria, track reconstruction, and $T_{AA}$. The pp uncertainty includes the same uncertainties for the pp data (except for $T_{AA}$) plus the uncertainties in pp yield and luminosity. The global PbPb uncertainty includes the uncertainty from the nonprompt fraction(accounting for a partial cancelation between pp and PbPb) and MB selection efficiency.
